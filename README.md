## Overview

In this challenge, we are presenting an analysis of Oaha's weather for the past 7 years. W.Avy, one of the investor for the Surf and Shake shop, requested for this analysis to be performed due to his past experience with weather being the major factor of closing his business. Through incorporating outside analysis from SQLite, we are able to succesfully present the case through organized dataframe and cleaned resources.
